# Restaurant Case Study

For this assignment we had to work in groups. Our task was to redesign a website for responsive viewing on desktop, tablet and mobile. We chose to redesign the website for this brief through the process of elimination in our research, as the restaurants current website was not responsive, aesthetically appealing nor user friendly.
